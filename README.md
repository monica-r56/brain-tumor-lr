# Dectection of brain tumor using Logistic Regression (Machine Learning)
**What is Logistic Regression?**<br/>
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not and diagnosing diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results.<br/>
<br/>
Brain tumor is classified into 3 categories:
**Glioma,
Meningioma,
Pituitary,
and Non-tumor cases**
<br/>
<br/>
**Why Logistic Regression for brain tumor detection?**<br/>
Logistic Regression is used to predict the outcome under two or more finite classes and it's easier to implement.<br/>
